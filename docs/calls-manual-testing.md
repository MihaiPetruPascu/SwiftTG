# Calls Manual Testing Checklist

Last updated: 29 August 2026

This checklist covers the current BetterTG call implementation on iOS. It is
intended for a real-device test session with a second Telegram account. Record
bugs separately and include the devices, iOS versions, network conditions, and
the exact step that failed.

## Test setup

- [ ] Use two iPhones with separate Telegram accounts and BetterTG installed on
  at least one device.
- [ ] Keep a third account or device available for conference tests.
- [ ] Allow microphone, camera, notification, and screen-recording permissions
  when requested.
- [ ] Confirm both devices can make ordinary Telegram calls before testing edge
  cases.
- [ ] Use an expendable group or conference where ending the call for everyone
  is safe.
- [ ] Record the BetterTG commit, build configuration, device models, and iOS
  versions used for the session.

## Private audio calls

### Chat Info and call history

- [ ] Open Chat Info for a regular user who accepts calls and confirm Call and
  Video appear alongside Search without duplicating the existing Mute or Unmute
  control from the Notifications section.
- [ ] Confirm Call and Video are absent for Saved Messages, bots, deleted users,
  support accounts, and users whose privacy settings do not allow the relevant
  call type.
- [ ] Start an audio call and a video call from Chat Info.
- [ ] Deny microphone or camera permission and confirm the corresponding Settings
  action is presented from Chat Info.
- [ ] Confirm completed history entries distinguish Incoming Call, Outgoing Call,
  Incoming Video Call, and Outgoing Video Call.
- [ ] Confirm unsuccessful entries distinguish Missed Call or Missed Video Call
  for incoming calls and Cancelled Call or Cancelled Video Call for outgoing
  calls.
- [ ] Confirm disconnected calls use Telegram-iOS's Cancelled wording.
- [ ] Confirm calls longer than one second show their duration, while zero- and
  one-second calls show only the message time.
- [ ] Confirm successful direction arrows are green and unsuccessful arrows are
  red, with the correct incoming or outgoing direction.
- [ ] Activate an audio or video call bubble and confirm it calls the same peer
  using the original media type.
- [ ] With VoiceOver, confirm the call type, direction, result, duration, date,
  and the call bubble's button behavior are understandable without duplicated
  announcements.
- [ ] Confirm the chat-list preview, conversation search result, and
  pinned-message preview no longer reduce every call to the generic word Call.

### Calls tab and call links

- [ ] Confirm the Calls tab appears between Contacts and Chats and loads recent
  private and conference calls in reverse chronological order.
- [ ] Switch between All and Missed and confirm the server-backed results match
  Telegram-iOS, including declined standalone conferences.
- [ ] Scroll past the first page and confirm pagination adds entries without
  duplicates.
- [ ] Start audio and video calls from call-history rows and from New Call;
  confirm the contact picker remains visible when permission or startup fails.
- [ ] Open a conversation from a call row's context menu and return to Calls.
- [ ] Delete one history item, then clear all call history and confirm the list
  refreshes on another Telegram client.
- [ ] Create a New Call Link without joining it, share it, reset it, and confirm
  the old link stops working while the replacement works.
- [ ] Start a conference from the new link, then create and delete another unused
  link.

### Standalone conference messages

- [ ] Confirm incoming and outgoing conference messages show the correct arrow,
  audio/video icon, participant count, and duration.
- [ ] Let a fresh unanswered invitation remain visible for 30 seconds and confirm
  it changes from Incoming Group Call to Missed Group Call without reopening the
  conversation.
- [ ] Decline an invitation and confirm the bubble reads Declined Group Call.
- [ ] Tap an active conference message and confirm the conference opens; tap an
  expired one and confirm a useful unavailable state.
- [ ] With another conference already active, tap a conference bubble and confirm
  BetterTG restores the active call instead of joining a second one.

### Outgoing call

- [ ] Mute and unmute locally; confirm both BetterTG and the remote party reflect
  the new state.
- [ ] Switch between the receiver, speaker, and an available Bluetooth route.
- [ ] Confirm signal-strength and weak-connection indicators update plausibly.
- [ ] Minimize the call, move through the app, and restore the full call view.

  and the call remains usable.

## Orientation and responsive layout

- [ ] Verify private-call UI in portrait on each supported iPhone size available.

  call remains portrait-only where intended.
- [ ] In iPhone landscape, confirm conference controls use the right sidebar and
  do not cover video or participant content.
- [ ] Rotate repeatedly between portrait and both landscape directions during a
  conference.
- [ ] Expand video, open messages, show the participant picker, and rotate in
  each state.

- [ ] If SOCKS5 proxy support is configured, place a call through the proxy and
  confirm connection and media flow.
- [ ] Terminate the call from the remote device during reconnect and confirm
  BetterTG leaves no active call or PiP UI behind.

## Accessibility

- [ ] With VoiceOver enabled, start, answer, operate, minimize, restore, and end a
  private call without relying on visual position.
- [ ] Confirm visible button titles are not announced twice and icon-only controls
  have accurate names and states.
- [ ] Confirm mute, camera, speaker route, participant, message, PiP, and screen
  sharing state changes are announced once and at useful times.
- [ ] Navigate the conference participant list and video tiles with VoiceOver;
  confirm participant actions remain reachable.
- [ ] Verify Dynamic Type through the largest accessibility sizes in portrait and
  landscape without losing essential controls.
- [ ] Enable Reduce Motion and confirm message, encryption-key, and conference
  transitions avoid large movement while remaining understandable.
- [ ] Enable Increase Contrast, Reduce Transparency, and Differentiate Without
  Color individually and confirm status and controls remain recognizable.
- [ ] Test Voice Control or Switch Control for the primary call actions if those
  input methods are part of the release accessibility target.

## Failure handling and cleanup

- [ ] Decline, cancel, miss, and fail calls from both sides; confirm each outcome
  clears the active UI and allows a new call immediately.
- [ ] Force-close BetterTG during ringing, connecting, and an active call, then
  relaunch and confirm there is no unrecoverable stale state.
- [ ] Receive a call invitation for a deleted or unavailable account and confirm
  the error does not block the app.
- [ ] Trigger camera, conference invitation, local video, and screen-sharing
  failures where practical and confirm the call itself remains usable.
- [ ] End calls from BetterTG, CallKit, the remote client, PiP, and the conference
  owner flow; confirm each path cleans up audio, video, screen sharing, and the
  idle timer.
- [ ] After a completed call, submit a rating with and without detailed problems
  and comments; also test Not Now and a failed submission.
- [ ] Place a new private call and join a new conference immediately after the
  previous session ends.

## Suggested smoke-test subset

Use this shorter pass after small call-related changes:

- [ ] Complete one outgoing and one incoming private audio call.
- [ ] Toggle mute, change audio route, minimize, restore, and end from CallKit.
- [ ] Complete one private video call with camera switching and PiP restoration.
- [ ] Join a three-person conference and verify audio, messages, participant
  updates, and one remote video.
- [ ] Rotate the conference to landscape and exercise the side controls.
- [ ] Start and stop screen sharing once, confirming the remote side stops
  immediately.
- [ ] Interrupt connectivity briefly and confirm the call recovers.
- [ ] Repeat the primary controls once with VoiceOver and Reduce Motion enabled.
