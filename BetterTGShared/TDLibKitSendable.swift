@preconcurrency import TDLibKit

// TDLibKit doesn't mark its generated types `Sendable`, so every value of theirs that crosses an
// isolation boundary (an actor-isolated method returning one, a closure capturing one) gets
// flagged under strict concurrency checking. In practice they're safe to send: every one of
// TDLibKit's ~1800 generated model files is a plain `struct`/`enum` built entirely from `let`
// stored properties (`Codable, Equatable, Hashable, Identifiable` value types decoded straight
// from TDLib's JSON) - there isn't a single class-based model in the whole generated surface, so
// there's no shared mutable state or reference identity for two copies to race over. `@unchecked`
// is required here only because the compiler can't synthesize `Sendable` for a type it doesn't
// own, not because these types need any actual runtime check the way `Media`/`MessageComposer`
// do elsewhere in this codebase.
//
// Only the types actually observed crossing isolation boundaries in this codebase are listed
// here - add to this list as strict-concurrency checking surfaces more, rather than trying to
// cover TDLibKit's full surface area up front.
